This commit (times relative to it): Small but critical usability fixes (making the setup page show if chat isn't setup). I should update so the invite code feature will show when it isn't the default 30.

1W - uploaded the latest code, it's run thru a secret stripper, but the changes made to it (and the 4MO commit) may not be compatible with other systems (reliance on /home/peplive, and maybe other site-specific stuff) without editing.

4MO: uploading the latest code from chat and captcha, am aware of the ALPHA typo in the other commit, it is written in stone sadly.

10MO ago: PM reply alpha code

Old: I am using github as a diff editor, my goal is to troubleshoot the code. (eg: np function, which somehow got completed, even though I didn't think it would be possible... surprising what a little persistence can do)
